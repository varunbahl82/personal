NRE account Opening grievances and careless attitude of an HDFC Branch Manager.

Hi, 

I am writing this to bring to your notice the highly unprofessional, careless and negligent attitude of a HDFC Branch Mananger, Sonepat, Model Town branch and a relationship manager in the same branch. Branch Manager's name is Mukesh Kumar Vijairania and the relationship Manager name is Sanjeet Kumar. 

Either these people are taking their job as granted or they are hignly incompetant to be sitting where they are. 

I am a resident of Singapore living here from past 3 years. On my last visit to India around 18th Sept 2015, i went to HDFC bank branch located in Model Town, Sonepat to convert my status from residential to NRO and to open a NRE account along with it and i signed all the required documents as asked.

The process to convert the account to NRO should not take more than 5-7 working days, but my request is still pending even after 45 days. I have written numerous email communications and made telephonic calls from Singapore to the RM and Branch Manager, but they have time and again failed to respond to my calls and emails. The emails were marked to 

Had they failed to respond once or twice, i would not have lost my patience to write all this to your department. But it happened so many times than i finally lost my patience and writing this to you to address it.

My frustration is why my request is still pending after one and half month while it is not suppossed to take more than a week. Secondly i am frustrated over the negligent attitude of the branch manager and the relationship mamager. Are they accountable and competant? do they need to justify they job? Do i deserve an explaination? Can a complaint be raised against them? I leave these questions for you to answer.
